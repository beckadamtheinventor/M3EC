#------ M3EC config file language explanation -------
#This is a comment.
#variable:  value       sets variable to value

#+variable: value       appends variable with value, or an array containing value if variable has not been set before.

#variable1:   value1     sets variable1 to value1
#.variable2:  value2     sets variable1.variable2 to value2
#.+variable3: value3     appends variable1.variable3 with value3
#spaces and tabs can be used interchangably between "variable: value" pairs.



#------- Test Ruby Mod M3EC manifest file --------
# mod namespace in-game is mod.class lowercased or can be set with "mod.mcpath: namespace"
#   in this example, testrubymod
# full mod namespace is formed by joining mod.prefix, mod.author, and mod.class, all lowercased. This can be set with "mod.package"
#   in this example, com.yourname.testrubymod

# Tell M3EC that this is a manifest file. Not really necessary, but here for consistency.
